Our group: Louis, Dan, Lorraine and Gadiza

#### Day 1

We started by setting up a Trello board to keep an eye on our progress. We discussed and established our ground rules including working hours, rotating pairings, rotating Project Managers and daily standups and retros.

We decided on our technology stack. JavaScript, Node.js, Express.Js, MongoDB and Cypress/Jasmine for our Testing.

To get the MVP(The smallest thing that implements the core idea.), we decided to start with two user stories:

##### User Story 1

As a user, so I can decide where to stay, I'd like to view a list of properties.

##### User Story 2

As a user, so I can contact the property owner, I'd like to view the owners contact details.

##### Division of Labour

One pair will be making the frontend HTML files with the properties and contact details hardcoded in and the other pair will be working on setting up our database.


#### Day 2 - 3

Having set up our database we updated our code to pull and push the data from the database and get rid of the hard coded properties and details in our html.

##### Completed User Stories

As a user (landlord), so I can tell people about the property, I'd like to provide a short description about it.

As a user (landlord), so I can rent out my property, I'd like to add my property to the list.

As a user(landlord), so that I can show all of my properties, I'd like to be able to post more than one.

#### Day 4

Having completed a signup and log in html page on day 2, we now need to get it functional and link it to a new database collection to complete the following user stories. We are also working on ensuring we have full test coverage for all of our code.

As a user(landlord), so that only I can post my properties, I'd like to be able to sign up.
